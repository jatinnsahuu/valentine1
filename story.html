    <h1>Our Little Story ❤️</h1>

    It's kind of strange how some people enter your life.  
    We never really talked before,  
    and I never imagined we'd become this close.  
    <br><br>

    And yet, even before we actually spoke,  
    I used to randomly mention you,  
    joke about you,  
    ask about you — without really knowing why.  
    <br><br>

    Maybe somewhere I already felt a connection,  
    even before I understood it.  
    <br><br>

    Then one day, I messaged you.  
    It wasn't planned. Even you say it was, but it wasn't, 
        - thoda sa interested tha alag baat hai 🤭 
    <br><br>

    But that one message changed everything.  
    <br><br>

    From that day, we started talking.  
    Then sharing.  
    Then slowly becoming important to each other.  
    <br><br>

    And without any big moment,  
    you became the person I look forward to talking to.  
    The person I feel calm with.  
    The person who feels like home.  
    <br><br>

    What started as something random  
    now feels like it was meant to happen.  
    <br><br>

    Maybe destiny doesn't come with signs and miracles.  
    Maybe it just sends the right person  
    at the right time.  
    <br><br>


    I don't know where life takes us,  
    but I know one thing —  
    I'm really glad it brought me to you.  
    <br><br>

    <strong>And I'm even happier that you said YES ❤️</strong>  
    <br><br>

    — Me, choosing you.
